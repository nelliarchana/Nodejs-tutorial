essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in

human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contvAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not

distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.

critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error

it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works

Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.

Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is

semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works

Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But

it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the cont

on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a

distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contvAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in

distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit

confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.

critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.

critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the cont
Abstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a

distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be

critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.

are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contvAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus

semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change

most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a

distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error

it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we

Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But

it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in

In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be

typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works

Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a

distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive

level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But

it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.

categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes

not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is

critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.

are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may

a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change

on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of

error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Bengali language processing significantly.

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error

it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contvAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.

For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.

are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is

sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.

semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.

to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the

a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus

critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
are typing on the editor during chatting, mailing etc. usually we
forget to maintain the rules of writing. That is why errors may
occur frequently. And, importantly we cannot recognize them
most of the time due to lack of knowledge. So, now it becomes
a common expectation of auto correction in our text.
Error occurs in different level like word level, sentence level
etc. When we find error in our spelling of a word it says word
level error. But, when an error occurs semantically, we know it
as sentence level error. That means, when a word is correct but
not appropriate for this sentence in that position, we say it
semantic error. It is also known as context sensitive error.
Kukich [1] says about many types of error like real word error
and non-word error. It is easy to detect non-word error. But
detection of real word error is not so easy. In Bengali language,
it becomes more difficult to detect when an error occurs in
semantic level.
In Bengali language, context sensitive error can be
categorized into homophone error, homonym error,
typographical errors, grammatical errors etc. Here, we do focus
our attention on typographical error. Typographical error also
covers homophone error. Typographical error occurs during the
typing. During typing, if we type extra character or miss to type
character, it changes the word. But unfortunately, after change
the word, if it remains correct then it destroys the contAbstract—Detection and correction of errors in Bengali text is
essential. In general, Bengali text error can be classified into nonword error and semantic error (also known as context sensitive
error). Till date, auto-correction for semantic error in Bengali
sentence is challenging since there is no significant research works
on this very topic. In this paper, we bring out the concept of
Semantic Error detection and correction. We have developed a
method that can detect and correct this kind of errors. Semantic
error includes typographical error, grammatical errors,
homophone errors, homonym error etc. Our goal to this study is
to develop an approach to handle multiple semantic errors in a
sentence. We have used our own built confused word list by edit
distance and apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect and correct
typographical and homophone error. For a candidate word from
a sentence, we pick out a set of words which is a collection of
confused words. We use all other neighbor words as features for
each word from confusion set. Then we apply naïve theorem to
calculate the probability and decide whether a target word is error
or not. We have used 28,057 sentences to evaluate our model and
we have achieved more than 90% accuracy. All data corpora used
to evaluate the model are built by us. We strongly believe that the
problem we have solved may shed light on the advancement of
Bengali language processing significantly.

I. INTRODUCTION
Writing is the most important way of communication for
human. Writing represents the human language with sign and
symbol and it works as a tool to make language readable.
Writing is used as alternate of spoken language. Writing is not
important only for communication but also for keeping records,
publications, and storytelling etc. Writing helps us to passing
history generation to generation, to maintaining culture etc.
Every language has a style to represent it in textual form.
Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world with around
250 million peoples, which has its own sign and symbol in
textual representation. At present it is important to process a
language with computer system.
For official and non-official purpose, we do process our
Bengali language in computerized system. Bengali language has
critical grammatical rules and complex orthographical rules.
That is why it is not soft to process Bengali language. When we
